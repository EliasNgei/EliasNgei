- ⚡ Fun fact: The first-ever computer-generated music was
  created in 1951 by Alan Turing's colleague, Christopher Strachey.
   He used Turing's computer, the Ferranti Mark 1, at the University of Manchester to generate music.
   The program played melodies like "God Save the Queen" and "Baa Baa Black Sheep,"
   marking the fusion of computer programming and music for the first time!
